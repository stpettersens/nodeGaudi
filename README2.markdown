nodeGaudi [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stpettersens/nodeGaudi.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stpettersens/nodeGaudi)
--------

Gaudi implemented with Node.js.

Like the original implementation of Gaudi, nodeGaudi uses JSON-based documents as build files. Additionally, nodeGaudi supports CSON-based (*CoffeeScript Object Notation*) documents as build files,
courtesy of the [CSON module](https://github.com/bevry/cson).
